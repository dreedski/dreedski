- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dreedski
- ðŸ‘€ I have completed my Associate's Degree in Computer Science from Roger's State University
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently continuing my learning of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything that goes with it. I am mainly working on TeamTreeHouse at this moment. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me...drew.reed@hotmail.com

I am looking to get into the field to gain experience. I am aware, that my current lack of experience is my greatest weakness. No worries, during my time obtaining my AS I learned the foundation, as well as "how" to learn. My ability and willingness to learn are my greatest strengths, and if you were to ask me, this outweighs my weakness. All I need is a chance to prove myself, it will not be regreted.
